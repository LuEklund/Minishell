SEGFAULTS WITH ONLY SPACES
|| works in syntax
wild cards works in quotes even though they shouldn't

try 'cat /dev/urandom and spamming ctrl-c until it stops'
cd doesn't work in the child process
lol segfaults if no || or &&
on my version echo didn't work properly without args
'cat < file a b' doesn't work like it's supposed to
